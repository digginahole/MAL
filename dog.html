                <h1>More about his dog...</h1>
                <p>Olegs dog is one of the most interesting subjects to discuss, as you would think someone in the deep siberian tundra would be more inclined to buy a dog that was much larger, meaner, and would pose a threat to anyone who crossed its path. Setting these considerations aside, Olegs backwards logic was to find one of the most timid dogs and give it a name that implied a more dangerous and threatening ring. When he got this dog, his peirs thought he would buy a shepard, but instead bought what looked like a mop that had legs and was walking around. It was later discovered that this was a compromise between him and his landlord, who was heavily against pets in the appartments, and wouldn’t allow a pet unless it weighed under 20 pounds. Luckilly, some woman was giving away puppies nearby, and oleg bought himself one of the smallest dogs they had. This website was designed to point out the rediculous and comedic companionship between ones very small dog, and a thin 6’6” romainian who constantly go through many adventures, driving hundreds of kilometers to vistit Babu (grandma), the store to buy groceries, and visiting the comrades down town to have fun. </p>
