            Common problems I am having developing this webpage:
        </h1>
        <p>
            Okay, so i am having a problem that is persistant in chrome. I open this webpage in firefox and for some reason, all of my problems subside. This makes no sense to me, as I have not seen this act in a weird way. Please, shoot me an email at fillinahole@gmail.com (personal email) and help me find out why my webpage acts weird. It would mean much to me.

            Solved:
        </h1>
        <p>
            I figured it out. It had to do with my rows in grid, so I removed the rows after and replaced it with auto. Doing this left me with the proper spacing for my page.
